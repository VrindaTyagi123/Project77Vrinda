    <h2><p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.

        <h1><p>What is Console Screen? Why is it used? How to open console screen? How to print everything?</p></h1>
        <h2><p>When doing a console application in Java with Eclipse, we see the output being put in a text box in the IDE itself, instead of having a console popping up like in Visual Studio. This comes in handy, as even after the program has exited, you can still make good use of the text that was written in it, as it doesn't get erased until I run it again.<br></p>

            <p>Visual Studio Code (or other IDEs like e.g. Eclipse) console applications are running on a console integrated in the IDE. When the app has finished, the output is still visible.<br></p>
            
            <p>To open the console screen, open the folder in which you have added one more folder. After clicking on the folder, you will see the index.html file. Right click on it and click on Open With and then click on Google Chrome. Or, you may also a Go Live option on bottom right of the code you have written. Click on it and you will see the console screen.<br></p>
            
            <p>Click the "Console" tab in that window. You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.<br></p>
